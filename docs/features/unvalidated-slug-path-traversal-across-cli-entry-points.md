## Summary

Three command families build filesystem paths from an unchecked positional argument, giving a local path-traversal read/write primitive in commands that automated gate flows invoke routinely. `src/core/slug.ts` already states that every external path-building entry point must use the canonical validator; these call sites do not. Validate at the start of each exported library function — not only in argv parsing — before any `exists`, read, process launch, kill, or git call, and return the same invalid-slug diagnostic worktree creation already uses. Then audit every other CLI that forms a path from argv, so the fix is not a three-call-site patch around a shared policy failure. Subprocess tests: slash, dot-dot, leading/trailing/doubled hyphens, uppercase, Unicode — assert no read or write spy fires and an outside sentinel file stays byte-identical.

- `worktrees up` / `worktrees down`: `upWorktree()` computes `join(opts.cwd, '.worktrees', opts.slug)` before validation and only calls the validating `createWorktree()` when that path does not already exist, so an existing outside directory — or `--no-create` — bypasses the sole guard, after which Noldor can open an editor, launch an agent, and boot configured commands there. `downWorktree()` builds the pid-file path the same way and, with `--remove`, hands `join('.worktrees', opts.slug)` to `git worktree remove --force`. A deep enough value in the prefixed pid filename also escapes `.noldor`, letting the command read a foreign `.pids` file and treat its second column as process-group IDs.
- `features phase-flip-done` / `features phase-revert`: both take the first non-flag token straight into `join(process.cwd(), 'docs', 'features', slug + '.md')` without importing the shared validator. From a consumer root `/consumer`, `../../../escape` resolves to `/escape.md`, and the command rewrites that file if it exists and contains the expected phase text.
- Milestone draft/load/activate: `src/milestones/lib.ts:55-76` and `:90-99` interpolate the slug into `docs/milestones/<slug>.md` and the CLI forwards `rest[0]` verbatim, so `draft` can create an outside file when its parent exists and `activate` can read and rewrite one carrying milestone-shaped frontmatter. `FeatureFrontmatterSchema.milestone` and vision's `current-milestone` are only non-empty strings, so repository-authored references feed non-slugs deeper into milestone readers — encode the slug schema in milestone, feature and vision validation so invalid state cannot load at all.
