## Summary

35 module entrypoints gate their CLI body by comparing `import.meta.url` against a hand-built string of `file://` concatenated with `process.argv[1]`. That comparison is false whenever the repository path needs percent-encoding — one space in a directory name is enough — so the module exits 0 having run nothing, with no diagnostic. For the hook and validator entrypoints among them, that is a silently disabled gate: the framework reports success precisely when it checked nothing. `src/cli/index.ts` and `src/hooks/noldor-pre-push.ts` already use the correct `pathToFileURL(process.argv[1] ?? '').href` form; sweep every remaining site to it.

- Confirmed call sites — all 35, measured by grepping `src/` for the literal comparison on 2026-08-14. **`src/hooks/` (6, the material cluster — these are the gates):** `noldor-pre-commit.ts`, `noldor-validate-trailer.ts`, `noldor-inject-trailers.ts`, `noldor-enforce-review-receipt.ts`, `noldor-pre-edit-guard.ts`, `agent-rules-guard.ts`. **`src/worktrees/` (6):** `create-worktree.ts`, `down-worktree.ts`, `up-worktree.ts`, `launch-worktrees.ts`, `worktree-conflicts.ts`, `worktree-status.ts`. **`src/core/` (6):** `validate-noldor-scope.ts`, `validate-noldor.ts`, `validate-skill-catalog.ts`, `changelog.ts`, `rename-plan-only-tier.ts`, `pr-flow-cli.ts`. **`src/rules/` (3):** `cli-list.ts`, `cli-resolve.ts`, `cli-validate.ts`. **`src/features/` (3):** `fill-links-code-gaps.ts`, `migrate-changelog-unreleased.ts`, `migrate-fd-commits-to-prs.ts`. **`src/checks/` (2):** `check-template-sync.ts`, `check-shared-files.ts`. **`src/cr/` (2):** `orchestrate.ts`, `codex.ts`. **`src/design/` (2):** `context-cli.ts`, `log-cli.ts`. **Singles:** `src/triage/validate-triage.ts`, `src/cli/validate-script-catalog.ts`, `src/milestones/validate-milestones.ts`, `src/prep/print-format.ts`, `src/release/index.ts`.
- Two shape variants, one defect: `src/core/rename-plan-only-tier.ts:109` interpolates a destructured `argv[1]` and `src/milestones/validate-milestones.ts:61` assigns to a `const isMain` rather than branching inline. Both are the same template bug — do not read them as a second class.
- The regression test wants a fixture checkout whose path contains a space, asserting each swept entrypoint still executes its body — a unit test on the comparison helper alone would not have caught the class, since every site re-derives it inline.
- The work is mechanical — one-line replacement per site plus the shared fixture — so the sweep breadth is scope, not complexity. Do not over-prep it on the file count alone.
