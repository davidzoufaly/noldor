# Roadmap

Flat priority-ordered list (file order = priority); H3 headings group related entries.

Each entry carries a `- id: Q-NNNN` bullet — a stable ID minted at triage and never rewritten; it survives heading renames and roadmap ↔ backlog moves, so `blocked-by:` references target it, not the rename-fragile slug (the slug is a human-readable alias). See [triage.md → Stable entry IDs](noldor/triage.md#stable-entry-ids).

An entry may declare dependencies with a `- blocked-by: <slug|Q-id, …>` bullet (comma-separated) — the entries this work waits on. It feeds dependency-weight scoring, and `validate:triage` flags refs that resolve to no known entry (`unknown-blocked-by-ref`; advisory, error under `--strict`) while `/garden` flags circular chains. `- deps:` is the legacy alias, still accepted during the migration window and unioned with `blocked-by:`; prefer `blocked-by:` in new entries.

> **Routing policy — prep scales with `size:`. Don't spec the small ones.**

> - **XS / S** → no spec, no plan. `/gate` routes these to `fast-track` (code) or `micro-chore` (pure-doc) and retires the entry on ship — the drain-runner's bread and butter.
> - **M** → `specs-only` (spec, no plan).
> - **L / XL** → `full` (spec + plan), and only when there's real design risk — a mechanical L can still fast-track.
>
> Encoded once in [`sizeToPath()`](../src/core/size-routing.ts); `/gate` Step 0 surfaces the verdict as each entry's `suggestedPath`. Full matrix in [complexity-gating.md](noldor/complexity-gating.md).

> Section order = execution phases from the 2026-07-02 queue verification. Retired that day: `fd-complexity-tier-field` (shipped as `noldor-tier`), `runtime-architecture-invariant-expansion` + `dashboard-reference-api-subtree` (Charuy-only premises), `dispatch-next-priority-via-agent-window` (covered by `noldor autonomous run --max-features 1` + `/gate` Step 0 priority pickup). `prefix-skills-with-noldor` re-sized S→L and parked in backlog.

#### Noldor Section-Age Staleness Detector

- id: Q-0004
- area: tooling
- type: feat
- since: 2026-05-08
- size: M
- impact: low
- parent: noldor

Was originally Detector 14 in the Noldor extraction spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-noldor-framework-extraction-design.md`); deferred during review because the value depends on actual drift accumulating, and the section-boundary detection is fiddly (header renames break the heuristic). Trigger: revisit if Detectors 14 (stub regrowth) + 15 (rule contradiction) prove insufficient — i.e. if framework drift slips past both gates and shows up as user-reported confusion or `/garden` blind spots. Implementation sketch: parse CLAUDE.md / README headers, run `git log -L /^## <Section>/,/^## /` per section, compare last-touched dates between CLAUDE.md side and `noldor/<page>.md` side, flag >30 day gaps in either direction.

#### Real-Codex Integration Smoke Test

- id: Q-0005
- area: tooling
- type: test
- since: 2026-05-10
- size: M
- impact: low
- parent: noldor

`src/cr/__tests__/codex.test.ts` mocks the `Spawn` function, so all CI runs of the codex lane validate the wiring without ever invoking the real `codex` binary. The first real-codex run will surface integration bugs the mocked tests can't catch (codex CLI flag drift, JSON schema variance, stdin-pipe encoding edge cases). Add a manual / opt-in smoke test (`pnpm noldor cr codex --dry-run` against a fixture worktree, gated behind `NOLDOR_RUN_REAL_CODEX=1`) plus a documented operator-side pre-release dogfood step in `docs/noldor/cr-pipeline.md`. Trigger: when codex CLI grows a stable `cr --json` subcommand (currently absent).

#### Path Rename: docs/superpowers to docs/design

- id: Q-0006
- area: tooling
- type: refactor
- since: 2026-06-11
- size: S
- impact: med
- parent: noldor
- recovered: 2026-06-11

Separable last step split out of `de-superpowers-vendor-spec-plan-and-worktree-flows` at its promotion: rename `docs/superpowers/` → `docs/design/{specs,plans}`. `src/core/doc-roots.ts:30-31` is the single code seam; everything else is prose/links. Ship as a migration (via the shipped `noldor upgrade` chain) that moves files and rewrites links; keep a transition alias in doc-roots for one release. Trigger: bundle with the next migration-bearing release rather than shipping alone — the rename is cheap but touches every spec/plan link, so ride a release that already asks consumers to run `noldor upgrade`.

- Still using the superpowers worktree path → move specs/plan out of the `superpowers/` folder as part of this rename.
